# Introduction

We are the Open Atomic Open Source Society **(OAOSS)** of China University of Petroleum **(CUP)**. We pursue building an open-source sharing website that collects data from CUP. And We call this project **CUPDS**.

# Plan

Here is our concise plan. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to submit issues!

## Learning 

### Early stage

Everyone starts from the front-end, and after learning the basic content, they begin to distinguish between the front-end group and the back-end group. The front-end group starts practicing (starting with some simple things), while the back-end group starts learning the back-end (which may require more effort).

Actually the front-end is much easier than the back-end, so the focus of learning should be more inclined towards the back-end xD

### Mid-term

At this stage, several static websites should be developed (also related to schools, such as small information sites, personal blogs, etc.).

After the backend team has completed basic learning, we will start planning the CUPDS framework.

### Later period

Open source requires starting from scratch. Everyone should work hard on the basic usage of GitHub, participate in the organization's code submission, and the department head and chairman have control over the repository to ensure orderliness and avoid errors.

## Let's start!

### Phase I

Create the overall framework of the website, including the homepage, login system, file upload and download (categorized).

### Phase II

Optimize the overall design, from content to file system.

### Phase III

Consider implementing a system similar to levels/achievements/titles. Encourage everyone to upload files (with no download restrictions).

Also Promote on a large scale, invite students to upload materials widely, review and classify, establish a three-level hierarchy of chairman, department head and staff, and submit them for approval in sequence.

### Phase IV

Try consulting with CUP to see if they can bring in the second classroom, or at least create a list of second classroom activities, and click to jump to the original website.

# Imagine

Our ultimate goal is to create a massive open-source data website where you can find **almost any** school, neighborhood, employment, and other content you want (theoretically, all of which are **uploaded by students**).

In this way, whether it is freshmen or other students who need certain materials, this website will be the **most convenient and efficient** choice. Of course, everything is open source and **free**, which is exactly our original intention.

**Alright, let's start this unprecedented great cause. Cheers!**
